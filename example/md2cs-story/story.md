### Conclusions

* We have shown a way of like a fully oriented world to objects we can
  use the characteristics that exist in the functional languages such
  as lambdas expressions.
* Generality not only works in the early stages of object-oriented
  programming but is also the fundamental basis of programming with
  lambdas expressions.
* A language like Java is a language because of a large number of
  builders.
